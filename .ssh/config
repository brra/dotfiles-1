# Modern .ssh/config by @benmontour

## Defaults

Host *

### Ignore Unknown Config Options. This suppresses an error on non-macOS systems

  IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain

### Specify default IdentityFile. This will be used for any host where we don't specify a specific IdentityFile

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

### Show ASCII art representation of remote host fingerprint

  VisualHostKey yes

### Ask to import other HostKeys that the host supports. May help move to a more secure key exchange if the host supports it but you didn't have the key imported

  UpdateHostKeys ask

### Force use of public key authentication by default

  PubkeyAuthentication yes

### Avoid password-based authentication whenever possible. Use ssh keys or certificates only

  PasswordAuthentication no

### Disable Challenge/Response Authentication

  ChallengeResponseAuthentication no


### Do not permit any local command execution

  PermitLocalCommand no

### Disable agent forwarding by default, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection

  ForwardAgent no

### Server Keep Alive for 15min (60 sec x 15 counts)

  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ServerAliveCountMax 15

### This shouldn't be needed anymore in modern OpenSSH versions. I leave it here because it also doesn't hurt anything and just makes me feel better. It is a workaround for SSH Client bugs CVE-2016-0777 and CVE-2016-0778

  UseRoaming no

### Add keys to SSH agent

  AddKeysToAgent yes

### If on macOS, and using the built in OpenSSH client, then use Apple Keychain to store SSH key passwords. This doesn't work with our upgraded OpenSSH client that allows us to use hardware backed SSH keys though. Left here as it doesn't hurt anything

  Match exec "uname -s | grep Darwin"
    UseKeychain yes

## Host specific configs

#Host github.com
#  HostName github.com
#  User git
#  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github_ed25519_sk
